This is the developer's guide to this landing page.

This folder contains everything you need to get a landing page up and running on any WordPress website.

Step 1: This entire folder must be placed in the root of a websites' active WP theme

Step 2: Install the zipped Home Value Plugins on the WP website.

Step 3: Create a new page and activate the template titled "Real Estate Landing Page"

Step 4: Configure Home Value Plugin and add Premium Credits, if action has been approved for client https://homevalueplugin.com/.
- The client will need their own account for the homevalueplugin
- Confirm what email all submissions will go to and what extra platforms they would like us to send the forms to.
- - There is a web-hook functionality that you can simply paste an endpoint url into that will submissions will then be sent to. Leadsbridge can also be used if endpoint url can't be sent directly to platform.

Step 6: All File Paths should be updated
- Simply search all and replace "twentynineteen" with the name of the client's theme folder

Step 7: Replace Placeholder "shortcodes" with company information
- Use search ALL and replace these strings: [MAIN-URL], (480) 200-2914, [EMAIL], [BUSINESS NAME]
- This will help you input all of the company information faster.
- Examples:
- - 1. Type "[MAIN-URL]" exactly then replace with something like "https://signamarketing.com/"
- - 2. Type "(480) 200-2914" then replace with "(602)-594-4219". This will be the company number
